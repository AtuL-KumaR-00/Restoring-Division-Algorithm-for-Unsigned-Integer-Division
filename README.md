### Implementation of Restoring Division Algorithm for unsigned integers in Verilog

A division algorithm provides a quotient and a remainder when we divide two number. They are generally of two type slow algorithm and fast algorithm. Slow division algorithm are restoring, non-restoring, non-performing restoring, SRT algorithm and under fast comes Newtonâ€“Raphson and Goldschmidt.

Here, register Q contain quotient and register A contain remainder. Here, n-bit dividend is loaded in Q and divisor is loaded in M. Value of Register is initially kept 0 and this is the register whose value is restored during iteration due to which it is named Restoring.
